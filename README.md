Thank you for your interest in Highlightme!

In order to use this project, please read the following directions.

This project is a Chrome extension; if you have experience using Chrome extensions, the process of using this extension is the same as the process of using another extension
in developer mode.

To use this project, download the Highlightme folder to your desktop (if it's zipped, unzip it).
Then, in Google Chrome, go to chrome://extensions/
Click on load unpacked, select the folder Highlightme (which you just downloaded),
and press Select.
After this occurs, you should have a small marker icon in the upper right hand
corner of your screen.

To use the extension, click on the marker icon when you are on a webpage. When clicked,
a popup emerges which has four options. The top one is a highlighter; use this to
highlight. The second one allows you to bold words on the page. The third one
allows you to underline words on the page. Finally, the last one will erase
all of the highlights and underlines made to a page.

When a page is reloaded, the annotations should pop back up.
